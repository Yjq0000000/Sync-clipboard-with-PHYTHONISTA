# Sync-clipboard-with-PHYTHONISTA
These are na√Øve codes used on pythonista on teo iOS devices to sync the clipboard.

How to use:
  Copy these codes and create those two scripts in two different devices. 
  And let the devices in the same intranet. 
  Then run the get.py on device 0 and you should get a two-dimensional code. 
  Then run the send.py from the another device called device 1 and scan it. 
  Then the clipboard on device 1 would be synced to the clipboard on the other device. You can transfer texts or images.



Features:
  It can tranfer large data.
  It must be run in the same intranet.



What would be done next:
  Scan for one time, it works for several times. But now you have to scan it for one time and sync it for one time, and next several times, you must run these two scripts again.



Open source:
  Everyone can use it for free, and change it anyway. And you can choose to open source or not.



PS: 
  I'm preparing for TOEFLE now, so I try everything in English to practice. But my English is bad so please help me by pointing mistakes out to me. Thanks a lot.
